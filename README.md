# Archived - Genetic Algorithm

This project, now archived, was dedicated to the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm. Its objective was to generate five-letter words through a large population generated after random crossovers. The final goal was to identify a word that met the criteria of having five similar letters.

## Purpose

Genetic Algorithms are a fascinating way to solve optimization and search problems inspired by the process of natural selection. This project aimed to explore their application in generating words based on specific criteria. The algorithm and methods used were derived from various sources, including a minimalistic explanation available in [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_tutorial.pdf) and other research papers whose sources will be published later.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: A population of words with five random letters is created.

2. **Evaluation**: Each word's fitness is determined based on how many letters match the desired pattern (five similar letters).

3. **Selection**: Words with higher fitness are more likely to be selected for the next generation.

4. **Crossover**: Pairs of words are combined to create new words through a crossover process.

5. **Mutation**: Some letters in the new words may undergo random changes.

6. **Repeat**: Steps 2 to 5 are repeated for multiple generations.

7. **Termination**: The algorithm stops when it finds a word that meets the criteria or after a predefined number of generations.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the fascinating world of Genetic Algorithms, where solutions evolve over generations through selection, recombination, and mutation. It showcases the power of these algorithms in solving unique and creative problems.
